GRAPHpick is a mobile app built with Java and Android Studio that leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract data from graphs. Users can capture and upload to convert extract data into graphs.

Features:

OCR Technology: Extracts data from images directly through your mobile device.

Editing Data: Allows users to edit data to prevent typo.

Simple Interface: Easy-to-use design for capturing and processing images.

Limitations:

Accuracy: Data extraction may not be perfect; errors or typos might occur.

Image Quality: For best results, avoid images with filters or distortions. Clear, high-quality images yield better accuracy.

Tips: Ensure images are well-lit and free from visual distortions for optimal performance.
